# Teenager-part-time-job-management-system
A platform where teenager can find opportunities to do different jobs depending
upon their availability and hobbies. This will help in their overall development, give
them exposure and teach them management of time as well as how to be
independent from a young age. They can take up various jobs like tutoring, teaching
any sports or self-defence that they're good at.
